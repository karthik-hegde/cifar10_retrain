This is a simple update to the exsting CIFAR10 train model in TensorFlow.

It helps to load the trained weights into a npy file, and then post process it. You can reload the same and re-train.

This is meant to be used for anyone who wants to process the trained weights, for ex: Quantization.

From original TensorFlow version:

CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark in machine learning for image recognition.

Code in this directory demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) on both CPU and GPU. We also demonstrate how to train a CNN over multiple GPUs.
